Should have:
Refactoring for a simpler parameter extension
Set the middle of the distribution closer to parameter default or to the value detected during the analysis - Poisson distrib?
Add user-fixed parameters
    - Add flag telling the program to create distribution around that value
Implement multithreading
Autimatic visualisation of results and iterations in ggplot/matplotlib
Add parametrs
	r - PBS detecting threshold
	E - LTR must have edge signal
	F - 


0. Add parameter -E where element.site_presence is the probability that it will be turned on

3 implement a sensitivity analysis approach into the script

0.2 Implement better accuracy calculation

1. need to implement run_finder.py for case where multiple sequences are in the query fasta === CHECK IF THIS IS FUNCTIONAL

1.2 run_finder.py line 35 fails if multiple sequences are present in the input file

2. decide certain parameter evaluation based on info received while generating testing sequence

3. enable parameter F testing

5. fix output printing on line 78 in parameter_tester - prints the whole dictionary, this is incorrect

6 add no database functionality by detecting elements using repeat masker, TE-nester.... and the elements that overlap are using in the database.

some paths need to be changed to relative, so that they can be chosen by the user

perform analysis on FN or FP transposon

Run analysis in R



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
implement the final analysis of the count.csv files created by detection_region_analyser.py - DONE
set nester_run.py so that it finds the parameter in the file (so that positions arent necessary) - DONE
clean up detection_region_analyser.py and its sub-files - DONE
implement Parameter with element integration - DONE
Add true positives, false positives and false negatives into the output csv file DONE
